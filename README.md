# What is FastAPI?

---

FastAPI is a modern Python framework designed for simplicity, speed, and efficiency. It combines many modern Python features, such as type annotations and concurrency support, making API development simple.

## About the project

---

The project is based on an online course taught by Eduardo Mendes (@dunossauro) with the aim of facilitating the understanding of FastAPI and its best practices.

The focus will be on building a task manager (to-do list). This project will include the implementation of user authentication and complete CRUD operations.

To build the project, recent versions of tools available in 2025 will be used, such as FastAPI (version 0.115), Pydantic (version 2.0+), SQLAlchemy ORM, as well as Python (version 3.11/3.12/3.13) and Alembic for migration management.

In addition to building the project, the course will also include testing practices, using pytest. This approach aims to ensure that the developed APIs are not only functional, but also reliable and robust.
